# Configurations for hardware-accelerated machine learning

# If using Unraid or another platform that doesn't allow multiple Compose files,
# you can inline the config for a backend by copying its contents
# into the immich-machine-learning service in the docker-compose.yml file.

# See https://immich.app/docs/features/ml-hardware-acceleration for info on usage.
